# XnX Notation: Enhancing Graph-Based RAG Systems through Unified Path-Neighborhood Navigation

## 1. Temporal GNN Architectures for Time-Evolving Edges (2023–Present)
Recent dynamic Graph Neural Network architectures have advanced continuous-time graph learning, allowing edges with temporal attributes (e.g. active intervals [t1→t2]) to be leveraged. **Temporal Graph Networks (TGN)** remain a strong baseline: TGN introduces a memory module per node that updates with each interaction, enabling node embeddings to reflect historical context ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20TGN%20,consisting%20of%20three%20main%20modules)). This memory-based design captures long-term temporal influence, though it can be memory-intensive. **Temporal Contrastive Learning (TCL)** is a newer Transformer-based dynamic GNN which explicitly models temporal neighborhoods. TCL uses a graph-topology-aware Transformer with separate encoders for each interacting node’s history, then a co-attentional Transformer layer to capture inter-node dependencies ([[2105.07944] TCL: Transformer-based Dynamic Graph Modelling via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07944#:~:text=learning%20that%20captures%20both%20the,Benefiting%20from)). A contrastive objective (maximizing mutual information between future interaction node representations) further regularizes TCL, improving its robustness to noise ([[2105.07944] TCL: Transformer-based Dynamic Graph Modelling via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07944#:~:text=temporal%20neighborhoods%20associated%20with%20the,evaluate%20our%20model%20on%20four)). TCL’s strength lies in modeling both global semantics and local history via attention, though it incurs high computational cost due to stacked Transformer layers.

Another class of temporal GNNs focuses on *edge-centric* representations. **GraphMixer** (2022) dispenses with heavy graph convolutions entirely – it uses only MLPs and mean pooling to encode temporal link features and node features ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20GraphMixer%20,use%20of%20a%20GNN%20architecture)). Despite its simplicity, GraphMixer achieved competitive or state-of-the-art link prediction performance on several temporal graph benchmarks, with faster convergence and strong generalization ([Understanding Temporal Graph Evolutions](https://www.getfocal.co/post/understanding-temporal-graph-evolutions#:~:text=GraphMixer%2C%20created%20by%20Cong%20et,1)). Its minimalist design (no explicit message passing) yields efficiency benefits, but may miss complex structural patterns. In contrast, **CAW (Causal Anonymous Walks)** explicitly encodes temporal network motifs. CAW extracts temporal random walks from the graph and encodes them (with time differences) as feature sequences, which are aggregated to predict link existence ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=from%20temporal%20neighborhoods%20surrounding%20the,starting%20at%20the%20nodes%20involved)) ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=in%20an%20interaction,the%20observation%20of%20an%20interaction)). This allows modeling of temporally ordered paths (respecting the arrow of time), closely aligning with the XnX notion of a valid edge sequence [t1→t2]. CAW can handle streaming updates online, but relying on random walks may struggle if the network is sparsely connected.

Very recent architectures incorporate higher-order time dependencies. **De Bruijn GNN (DBGNN)** (2023) constructs *k*-th order “time-respecting” De Bruijn graphs to capture sequences of events within time windows ([Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.15865v2#:~:text=architecture%20that%20builds%20on%20,ordering%20and%20timing%20of%20interactions)) ([Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.15865v2#:~:text=graph%20models%20for%20multiple%20orders,48)). By performing message passing on multiple such higher-order graphs and then mapping back to the original nodes, DBGNN can learn node embeddings that reflect complex temporal path patterns beyond pairwise interactions ([Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.15865v2#:~:text=Using%20the%20update%20rule%20defined,use%20a%20final%20dense%20linear)) ([Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.15865v2#:~:text=that%20are%20active%20in%20the,encodings%20during%20the%20training%20phase)). This yields significantly improved predictions for temporal path-based metrics (e.g. temporal betweenness centrality) compared to standard GCNs or even TGN ([Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.15865v2#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20performance%20of,respecting%20paths)). DBGNN’s consideration of time-ordered paths directly encodes constraints akin to [t1→t2] within the architecture, at the cost of greater complexity (multiple graphs and an additional aggregation stage). Similarly, **Temporal Graph Transformers** have emerged (e.g. DyGFormer) that break long interaction histories into patches and apply self-attention to capture long-range time dependencies ([Understanding Temporal Graph Evolutions](https://www.getfocal.co/post/understanding-temporal-graph-evolutions#:~:text=The%20DyGFormer%20architecture%2C%20introduced%20by,based%20patterns%20more%20efficient%20%5B1)). These Transformer-based models handle temporal sequences flexibly but are resource-intensive.

**Key takeaway:** Modern temporal GNNs can incorporate edges that appear, disappear, or change over intervals. Memory modules (TGN) effectively capture persistence but must manage forgetting of old data. Attention-based models (TCL, temporal Transformers) excel at modeling complex temporal relationships (like overlapping time intervals or multi-hop time-respecting paths), aligning well with XnX’s `[t1→t2]` semantics, though often with high computational overhead. Simpler approaches (GraphMixer, EdgeBank variants) show that even with minimal architecture, carefully leveraging recent temporal neighbors or sliding time windows can yield strong results ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20EdgeBank%E2%88%9E%20,Dynamic%20Node%20Property%20Prediction%20Task)) ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20TGN%20,for%20the%20current%20time%20t)) – suggesting that for unified PathRAG/GraphRAG, a hybrid approach might balance complexity and efficiency. For the proposed system, architectures supporting **temporal edge attributes** (like CAW’s time-encoded walks or DBGNN’s higher-order time graphs) are most relevant, as they inherently respect constraints on edge timing and order.

## 2. Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning: Macro vs. Micro Levels (2023–2025)
Hierarchical graph representation learning has gained attention as researchers seek to combine **macro-level navigation** (global or high-level structure) with **micro-level neighborhood analysis** (local detail). This aligns with the XnX approach of unifying PathRAG (global relational paths) and GraphRAG (local neighborhood retrieval). Recent works explicitly integrate multiple levels of graph abstraction. For example, **HiRAG (Hierarchical RAG)** by Huang *et al.* (2025) introduces hierarchical knowledge into RAG: it leverages inherent ontologies or category hierarchies in knowledge to bridge “local and global knowledge” ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10150v1#:~:text=Graph,art)). The HiRAG framework indexes information in multiple layers (e.g. a base knowledge graph and an abstracted higher layer) and shows that using this hierarchy during retrieval significantly improves LLM performance over flat graphs ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10150v1#:~:text=knowledge%20,knowledge%20integration%20for%20comprehensive%20responses)) ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10150v1#:~:text=To%20evaluate%20the%20significance%20of,This%20ablation)). Essentially, HiRAG addresses the gap between fine-grained facts and big-picture context by retrieving both layers – a strategy very similar to XnX’s proposed macro-path + local neighborhood navigation.

In the domain of **knowledge-augmented QA**, hierarchical retrievers have shown clear benefits. **KG-Retriever** (Chen *et al.*, 2024) builds a two-layer index graph comprising a *knowledge graph layer* (entities and their relations) and a *collaborative document layer* (documents or text chunks linked via shared entities) ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=challenge%2C%20we%20introduce%20a%20novel,from%20the%20knowledge%20graph%2C%20KG)) ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=KG,of%20our%20proposed%20RAG%20framework)). At query time, the system first exploits the knowledge graph (macro-level) to traverse high-level connections between concepts, then pulls in specific document snippets (micro-level) via the links. This hierarchical retrieval substantially alleviates information fragmentation in multi-hop questions – the knowledge graph provides a scaffold connecting relevant pieces, and the document layer supplies detailed evidence ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=KG,of%20our%20proposed%20RAG%20framework)). KG-Retriever demonstrated improved efficiency and accuracy on challenging QA tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, validating the idea that a *two-tier navigation* (global entity network + local text) yields better coverage with less redundancy ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=of%20graph%20structures%20is%20fully,public%20QA%20datasets%2C%20showing%20the)) ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=fragmentation%20problem%20and%20meanwhile%20improving,of%20our%20proposed%20RAG%20framework)). The XnX unified system is analogous: a shared graph database could serve as the high-level map (with nodes or clusters linking related info), while neighborhood expansion fetches the low-level content at each step.

Hierarchical graph techniques also appear in specialized tasks. In knowledge graph question answering, **HamQA (Hierarchy-aware Multi-hop QA)** (2023) aligns question semantics with hierarchical relations in a knowledge graph ([Hierarchy-Aware Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/docs/2023theWebConf_Junnan.pdf#:~:text=concepts%20ubiquitously%20present%20hyponymy%20at,Answering%20framework%20on%20knowledge%20graphs)). For instance, a question involving *mammals* vs *animals* benefits from understanding the taxonomy: HamQA uses hypernym/hyponym relations (a_type_of links) to incorporate that macro concept hierarchy into the reasoning process ([Hierarchy-Aware Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/docs/2023theWebConf_Junnan.pdf#:~:text=concepts%20ubiquitously%20present%20hyponymy%20at,Answering%20framework%20on%20knowledge%20graphs)) ([Hierarchy-Aware Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/docs/2023theWebConf_Junnan.pdf#:~:text=question%20contexts%20and%20KGs,baselines%20on%20the%20official%20OpenBookQA)). By embedding the KG in hyperbolic space (naturally suited for tree-like hierarchies) and preserving hierarchical distances, HamQA improved multi-hop reasoning accuracy ([Hierarchy-Aware Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/docs/2023theWebConf_Junnan.pdf#:~:text=question%20contexts%20and%20KGs,baselines%20on%20the%20official%20OpenBookQA)). This demonstrates that using macro-level structures (ontology levels) in tandem with micro-level facts yields more complete reasoning. Likewise, **Graph-based RAG for private data** (Microsoft’s GraphRAG, 2024) implicitly creates a hierarchy by first prompting an LLM to generate a **knowledge graph of the dataset**, then navigating that graph to retrieve supporting facts ([GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM discovery on narrative private data - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/#:~:text=GraphRAG%20uses%20LLM,performing%20discovery%20on%20private%20datasets)) ([GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM discovery on narrative private data - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/#:~:text=tab%29%29,answering%20the%20two%20classes%20of)). GraphRAG addresses failures of flat RAG (which often misses connections or holistic themes) by ensuring the LLM’s retrieval covers *paths* through the generated knowledge graph, effectively forcing macro-level “connecting the dots” before drilling into specific documents ([GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM discovery on narrative private data - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/#:~:text=GraphRAG%20uses%20LLM,performing%20discovery%20on%20private%20datasets)) ([GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM discovery on narrative private data - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/#:~:text=and%20to%20our%20new%20approach%2C,GraphRAG)). The result is better Q&A performance on complex narrative data, confirming that a hierarchical path+neighborhood approach yields more **logical and comprehensive** answers ([[2502.14902] PathRAG: Pruning Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation with Relational Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14902#:~:text=methods%20lies%20in%20the%20redundancy,art%20baselines%20across%20six%20datasets)).

From a GNN perspective, hierarchical representation is often achieved via **graph pooling** or multi-scale encoders. Techniques like DiffPool, Graph U-Nets, and more recent pooling methods iteratively coarsen a graph, producing a pyramid of representations ([Graph Pooling for Graph Neural Networks: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0752.pdf#:~:text=3%20Approaches%20for%20Graph%20Pooling,1%20Flat%20Pooling)) ([Graph Pooling for Graph Neural Networks: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0752.pdf#:~:text=latter%20coarsens%20the%20graph%20gradually,same%20representa%02tion%20when%20the%20order)). The coarsened (macro) graph captures community-level or higher-order connectivity, while fine-scale (micro) nodes are still represented in lower layers. A 2023 survey on graph pooling notes that *hierarchical pooling* preserves structural information better than flat readouts, preventing information loss and improving performance on graph-level tasks ([Graph Pooling for Graph Neural Networks: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0752.pdf#:~:text=2021%5D%2C%20and%20GMT%20,Knyazev%20et%20al.%2C%202019)) ([Graph Pooling for Graph Neural Networks: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0752.pdf#:~:text=3,The%20main%20difference%20between%20the)). For the unified PathRAG-GraphRAG, one can envision pooling the underlying knowledge graph into “topics” or “contexts” as macro-nodes. Then, retrieval might first select a sequence of topics (path at macro level) and subsequently expand each to actual content pieces (micro neighborhoods). This approach resonates with the literature’s findings: combining global structure with local detail often outperforms either alone, particularly in tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning or diversified knowledge.

**In summary**, hierarchical graph learning in 2023–2025 emphasizes *multi-scale reasoning*. Systems like HiRAG and KG-Retriever explicitly build multi-layer graphs to ensure relevant context is captured at both coarse and fine granularity ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=challenge%2C%20we%20introduce%20a%20novel,from%20the%20knowledge%20graph%2C%20KG)) ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10150v1#:~:text=Graph,art)). These strategies align closely with XnX notation’s aim: representing knowledge such that an agent can navigate a **path** (macro-level route) while simultaneously examining each node’s **neighborhood** (micro-level evidence). The XnX approach differs mainly in implementation specifics (using the unified notation `w x d [t1→t2]` for edges and GLF constraints), but conceptually it stands on the shoulders of recent hierarchical techniques that confirm the value of path-neighborhood integration.

## 3. Evaluation Metrics: Path Relevance and Information Redundancy
**Path Relevance** and **Information Redundancy** are critical metrics to evaluate graph-based RAG systems like the unified PathRAG-GraphRAG. We define **Path Relevance** as the degree to which a retrieved chain of nodes/edges (documents, knowledge triples, etc.) is pertinent and necessary for answering the query. A highly relevant path will contain the key intermediate concepts or relations that logically connect the question to the answer. In practical terms, path relevance can be quantified by overlap with known ground-truth reasoning steps or by proxy metrics like multi-hop recall. For instance, multi-hop QA datasets (e.g. HotpotQA) include **supporting facts** for each question; one can measure what fraction of these facts appear in the retrieved path (Support Fact Recall) and the precision (proportion of path elements that are actually needed). Another approach is to use **Path Hits@K**: whether the system’s top-K retrieved paths contain a complete correct reasoning chain. If the underlying knowledge graph has labeled relation paths for certain queries (as in knowledge base QA), metrics like **path precision** and **path recall** can be computed by comparing the retrieved path to the known shortest path or relevant path in the graph. The PathRAG paper (2025) implicitly targets this by retrieving “key relational paths” and pruning extraneous branches ([[2502.14902] PathRAG: Pruning Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation with Relational Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14902#:~:text=methods%20lies%20in%20the%20redundancy,art%20baselines%20across%20six%20datasets)). We might use a metric like **Path F1**, treating the set of nodes or edges in the ideal path versus the system path as a precision/recall problem.

Beyond discrete evaluation, one can also evaluate path relevance via the final answer quality on tasks that inherently require multi-step reasoning. For example, using **MMLU** (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) or **BBH** (Big Bench Hard) questions that need reasoning, one can compare a system constrained to follow its retrieved path against an oracle. If path relevance is high, forcing the LLM to use the retrieved path should yield a correct answer. A drop in accuracy would indicate the path omitted something (low relevance). **Human evaluation** is also valuable: human judges can be asked to rate whether the connections in the retrieved path are logically relevant to the query. The E-KELL emergency decision system, for example, measured expert-rated *comprehensibility* and *instructiveness*, implicitly rewarding relevant, coherent reasoning chains ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=system%20called%20Enhancing%20Emergency%20decision,providing%20reliable%20emergency%20decision%20support)) ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=stages,group%20of%20emergency%20commanders%20and)).

**Information Redundancy** measures how much duplicate or superfluous content the system retrieves. In a graph RAG context, redundancy occurs when multiple retrieved nodes contain the same or highly overlapping information (e.g. two passages that repeat a fact, or a node whose neighbors all supply identical context). Excess redundancy can waste the LLM’s limited context window and may confuse generation (if the model overemphasizes repeated items). A clear metric for redundancy is the **Redundancy Ratio**, defined as the fraction of content overlap among retrieved pieces. For example, one can compute pairwise similarity (using cosine similarity of embeddings or ROUGE-L overlap) between all retrieved context chunks; a high average similarity means high redundancy. We can also measure the **unique information percentage**: if the system retrieves N chunks totaling M characters, compress them (e.g. via minimal set cover of facts or via compression algorithms) – the percentage of compressed length vs. original indicates uniqueness. Another approach, inspired by search result diversification metrics, is **α-NDCG** (alpha-normalized discounted cumulative gain) which penalizes giving credit for redundant documents. Adapting α-NDCG, we treat each distinct fact as a subtopic; if the same fact appears in multiple retrieved nodes, the later occurrences contribute less gain ([PathRAG: Pruning Graph-based Retrieval Augmented ... - ChatPaper](https://chatpaper.com/chatpaper/fr/paper/110346#:~:text=PathRAG%3A%20Pruning%20Graph,logical%20and%20coherent%20responses)) ([Graph RAG Evolved: PathRAG (Relational Reasoning Paths)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetP9uksUwM#:~:text=Graph%20RAG%20Evolved%3A%20PathRAG%20,Sounds%20a%20lot%20like%20PathRAG)). A high α-NDCG means the system presented information with minimal redundancy.

Concretely, open-source multi-hop QA benchmarks can be repurposed to evaluate these metrics. **HotpotQA** provides ground-truth supporting document sets for each question – an ideal testbed where Path Relevance can be scored by how well the retrieved paths cover those supporting docs (e.g. exact match count or F1). **FEVER** (fact verification) could also be used: relevant paths would include evidence for or against a claim, and redundancy would show if the system pulled the same evidence twice. For Information Redundancy, the **Natural Questions/OpenQA** setting can be insightful: if a system retrieves 10 passages from Wikipedia, one can quantify redundancy by how many contain the same answer sentence or highly overlapping text. A strong system might retrieve fewer but more diverse pieces. The PathRAG approach explicitly aims to reduce redundancy via *flow-based pruning* ([[2502.14902] PathRAG: Pruning Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation with Relational Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14902#:~:text=methods%20lies%20in%20the%20redundancy,art%20baselines%20across%20six%20datasets)), so one evaluation could be the average number of unique supporting facts used per answer (lower is better if caused by pruning redundant ones, assuming no drop in recall).

We also propose evaluating on **code generation tasks** (“Python Codegen”) where retrieving code context is helpful. For example, given a natural language prompt to generate code, the system might retrieve relevant API documentation or code snippets from a knowledge base. **HumanEval** or **MBPP** (Mostly Basic Python Problems) could be adapted: treat the function spec as a query, retrieve library docs or examples, and check if the path of retrieval (e.g. a chain linking a high-level library to a specific method implementation) is relevant to solving the problem. Path relevance here could be measured by functional correctness of the generated code – but more directly, one can manually define the needed steps (e.g. to generate code for “plot a graph”, the path might be [matplotlib → pyplot → usage example]). Did the system retrieve those steps? Redundancy in code retrieval would manifest as repeated retrieval of the same code snippet or multiple copies of the same documentation page – metrics like overlap of retrieved lines of code can quantify that.

**MMLU** (a collection of tasks including multistep reasoning problems) can serve to evaluate path relevance indirectly. Many MMLU questions require combining knowledge from multiple domains. A graph-based system could retrieve a path connecting those domain concepts. One could score the system on MMLU accuracy and analyze errors: if an answer is wrong, was the path incomplete (missing a needed link) or cluttered with irrelevant nodes? This ties the metric back to path relevance (complete vs. incomplete reasoning chain).

Finally, for **domain-specific or multi-modal knowledge bases**, one can create benchmarks where relevant paths are known. For instance, a medical QA dataset might come with a small ontology; an evaluation metric could be whether the retrieved path through the medical knowledge graph included the correct diagnosis node and relevant symptom nodes (path precision) without adding unrelated diseases (redundancy). A **multi-modal** example: a visual QA system using an image+text knowledge graph (e.g. linking image objects to Wikipedia concepts) can be evaluated on retrieval paths that include the correct visual object and the needed textual fact. The **MKGF** framework for medical VQA (2023) could provide benchmarks – it incorporates a multi-modal knowledge graph for reasoning ([MKGF: A multi-modal knowledge graph based RAG framework to ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092523122500671X#:~:text=,Author%20links%20open%20overlay%20panel)). Metrics could count if both the image evidence node and the textual medical fact node were retrieved (path relevance), and if extraneous identical facts were avoided (redundancy).

In summary, we recommend reporting **Path Relevance** with metrics like *Supporting Fact F1*, *Path Hits@K*, or performance on multi-hop benchmarks (which implicitly reflect path quality). **Information Redundancy** can be reported with *content overlap scores* or diversity metrics (like α-NDCG or unique recall). By using open resources – e.g. HotpotQA for text, CodeSearchNet/HumanEval for code, and multi-modal QA datasets for image+text – one can quantitatively assess how well the unified XnX system retrieves *just the right knowledge*: all that is needed (high relevance) and little that is repetitive (low redundancy).

## 4. Empirical Methodologies for RAG Systems Evaluation
When evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, especially graph-based ones, rigorous empirical methodology is crucial to obtain credible and reproducible results. **Repeated trials** are a best practice due to the inherent randomness in both retrieval and generation components. Graph-based RAG pipelines might involve random initializations (for retriever encoders or GNN weights), stochastic training processes (negative sampling, dropout), and nondeterministic generation (LLMs using sampling or beam search). It’s standard to run multiple independent trials and report mean and standard deviation of key metrics. For example, the Temporal Graph Benchmark evaluations run each model 5 times and report metrics as *mean ± std*, which clearly shows variability ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=GraphMixer%20,33%5D%200.600%200.571)). Adopting this, one should run the PathRAG-GraphRAG system multiple times on the test set, and report (for instance) an average exact match score with error bars. Consistent improvements beyond the error margins strengthen claims of superiority.

**Cross-validation** or careful dataset splits are also important. In many RAG scenarios, overfitting can occur (e.g. the system might memorize answers for seen questions if not properly separated). If the dataset is small, *k-fold cross-validation* provides a way to use all data for both training and testing in splits, ensuring robustness across different sample partitions. In larger benchmarks, a strict train/dev/test split should be enforced, and ideally the dev (validation) set is used for hyperparameter tuning (like how many graph hops to retrieve, how to weigh path vs neighbor context) to avoid test set bias. If the unified system involves components (like a graph retriever or reranker) that are learned, one might also shuffle and repeat the train/test split to check stability.

To validate improvements, **statistical significance testing** is recommended. For example, if comparing the unified XnX system to a baseline (say GraphRAG alone or PathRAG alone), one can use a paired significance test on the per-query scores. A common choice is the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test on metrics like accuracy or F1 per question. Since each question can be considered a paired sample (each system yields an outcome), a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) indicates the improvement is unlikely due to chance. Recent graph-augmented LLM research often mentions significance: e.g., KG-Retriever’s results showed consistent gains across five QA datasets, and significance can be inferred when improvements exceed the baseline by margins larger than variance ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L610%20Qwen,baseline%20methods%20on%20all%20datasets)) ([KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05547v1#:~:text=Qwen,baseline%20methods%20on%20all%20datasets)). While not all papers explicitly report p-values, providing them (or at least confidence intervals) would strengthen the evaluation rigor.

**Ablation studies** are another key part of empirical methodology. In a complex system blending PathRAG and GraphRAG, one should ablate components: evaluate performance when only local neighborhood retrieval is used, only path retrieval is used, when GLF constraints are turned off, etc. This identifies the contribution of each part. For example, HiRAG (2025) performed an ablation where they removed the hierarchical index (“w/o HiIndex”), which led to significant drops in win rates on QA tasks, demonstrating the value of the hierarchical approach ([Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10150v1#:~:text=To%20evaluate%20the%20significance%20of,This%20ablation)). Similarly, one could measure how enforcing GLF (Greatest Limiting Factor) constraints affects output: e.g., does limiting the search depth or nodes expanded improve factuality or coherence? Repeated trials for each ablation ensure observed differences are due to the removed component and not random fluctuations.

**Benchmark selection and diversity**: It’s important to evaluate on a range of benchmarks, as each test may stress different aspects of the system. For instance, include a **knowledge-intensive QA** dataset (like Natural Questions or TriviaQA) to see basic recall, a **multi-hop reasoning** dataset (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihop) to test path reasoning, a **complex dialog or instruction** set (like a domain-specific Q&A in science or finance) to test how the system works in long-form generation, and possibly a **code-based or multi-modal task** as discussed. The use of established benchmarks (MMLU, etc.) provides comparability with other systems. In addition, **open-source leaderboard evaluations** (if available) can be used – e.g., the KILT benchmark provides a suite of knowledge-intensive tasks with standardized evaluation scripts for retrieval and generation.

For generation evaluation, **human evaluation** is often indispensable, especially for qualities like coherence and usefulness of output that automated metrics struggle with. In the emergency decision support example E-KELL, domain experts rated outputs on multiple criteria ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=system%20called%20Enhancing%20Emergency%20decision,providing%20reliable%20emergency%20decision%20support)). Following that model, one might have experts or annotators rate the answers from the XnX system vs. baselines on clarity, correctness, and whether the reasoning (explicit or implicit) is sound. If the system provides provenance or highlighted paths, evaluators can judge if those are convincing and correct. Human eval should be done with multiple annotators and reported with inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Cohen’s kappa) to ensure consistency.

**Recent examples**: The PathRAG study (Chen et al., 2025) evaluated their method on six QA datasets and five evaluation dimensions, presumably including answer accuracy, reasoning coherence, etc., to comprehensively show improvements ([[2502.14902] PathRAG: Pruning Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation with Relational Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14902#:~:text=methods%20lies%20in%20the%20redundancy,art%20baselines%20across%20six%20datasets)). They likely performed multiple runs and included a qualitative analysis of pruned vs. unpruned context. Another example is GraphRAG (2024) which demonstrated improvement on private data Q&A via case studies – they showed concrete question examples where baseline RAG failed and GraphRAG succeeded by connecting a multi-hop path ([GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM discovery on narrative private data - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/#:~:text=Retrieval,performing%20discovery%20on%20private%20datasets)) ([GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM discovery on narrative private data - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/#:~:text=Baseline%20RAG%20GraphRAG%20The%20term,was%20conquered%20by%20the%20Russian)). While case studies are anecdotal, they strongly illustrate *how* the system’s behavior differs. Including a section of qualitative error analysis in the evaluation is good practice: e.g., “In 20% of errors, the path was relevant but an essential node was missing; in 15%, the path contained all info but the LLM still answered incorrectly – indicating perhaps a generation problem, etc.”

Finally, ensure **reproducibility**: share the graph construction code, the trained model (if any learning), and the evaluation scripts. The temporal graph learning community, for instance, introduced standardized evaluation pipelines (Temporal Graph Benchmark) to make results comparable and avoid “evaluation optimism” ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=Temporal%20Graph%20Methods,model%20performance%2C%20which%20helps%20facilitate)) ([](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/066b98e63313162f6562b35962671288-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf#:~:text=of%20TG%20learning%20methods,previous%20node%20history%20to%20generate)). Adopting similar discipline, one should pre-register the evaluation procedure or follow established evaluation harnesses (like the Eleuther AI LM Evaluation Harness for LLM tasks, or HuggingFace’s benchmarks for RAG). This prevents unintentional bias (like tuning on test data or cherry-picking outputs). By rigorously applying repeated trials, statistical tests, cross-validation, ablations, and using diverse benchmarks with standardized metrics, the performance of the unified PathRAG-GraphRAG system can be empirically validated with confidence.

## 5. Modeling Resource-Based Constraints (GLF) in Real-Time Graph Traversal
In complex graph traversal – especially when interacting with an LLM in real time – it’s essential to incorporate **resource-based constraints** to mimic realistic limitations. The “Greatest Limiting Factor” (GLF) in the XnX system represents such a constraint, which could be cognitive (attention span, memory) or computational (time, memory, token budget). There is rich literature on algorithms and frameworks that enforce resource constraints during graph search and reasoning.

**Classical graph search algorithms** have long handled constraints through specialized methods. For example, the *Resource Constrained Shortest Path* problem is a variant of shortest path where, in addition to path length, one must not exceed a resource limit (time, cost, etc.). Algorithms like **Multi-constraint A\*** or label-setting approaches carry a resource usage vector along with each partial path ([Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (SPPRC) | by Nabin Kafle | Medium](https://nabinkafle.medium.com/shortest-path-problem-with-resources-constraint-spprc-971ce9b9643e#:~:text=2,Let%27s)) ([Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (SPPRC) | by Nabin Kafle | Medium](https://nabinkafle.medium.com/shortest-path-problem-with-resources-constraint-spprc-971ce9b9643e#:~:text=node%2C%20Resource%20Vector%20consumed%20up,than%20or%20equal%20to%20L2)). Each node may hold multiple “labels” (states) representing reaching that node with different resource consumptions ([Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (SPPRC) | by Nabin Kafle | Medium](https://nabinkafle.medium.com/shortest-path-problem-with-resources-constraint-spprc-971ce9b9643e#:~:text=time%20elapsed%20for%20example,than%20or%20equal%20to%20L2)). A label dominating another (i.e. using no more resource but arriving no later) allows pruning the inferior one ([Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (SPPRC) | by Nabin Kafle | Medium](https://nabinkafle.medium.com/shortest-path-problem-with-resources-constraint-spprc-971ce9b9643e#:~:text=node%2C%20Resource%20Vector%20consumed%20up,than%20or%20equal%20to%20L2)). These algorithms dynamically **prune search branches** that would violate constraints, effectively enforcing GLFs like “do not exceed X cost”. In our context, if GLF = max tokens, we can treat token count as a resource and prune any path whose estimated token usage would overflow the limit. Similarly, **depth-limited search** (like Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search) is a simple way to enforce a traversal depth limit (a proxy for cognitive step limits) – it finds solutions up to depth *d*, then incrementally increases *d*, ensuring it never goes beyond what’s allowed at a given iteration.

In real-time scenarios (e.g. interactive systems that must respond quickly), **anytime algorithms** are useful. These algorithms (like Anytime Repairing A* or Real-Time Adaptive A*) find an initial feasible solution quickly (maybe suboptimal due to constraints), then refine it if time permits. For an LLM-based agent, an anytime strategy could mean: if the GLF (time) is low, quickly retrieve a short, possibly suboptimal path, but if user extends time, further improve the path. This ensures the system respects time limits yet can utilize extra allowance to improve results, aligning with the notion of GLF as a dynamic bound.

From a **sociotechnical perspective**, GLF can correspond to cognitive limits – for instance, an LLM agent has a limited “attention budget” or working memory. *Bounded rationality* theory (Simon, 1957) provides a framework for decision-making under such limitations: agents will “satisfice” (seek a good-enough solution rather than optimal) when resources are constrained. In AI, this translates to using heuristics to cut down search. For example, an agent might use a heuristic to only explore likely relevant neighbors (like preferentially follow high-weight edges `w` in XnX notation) rather than exhaustively expanding all neighbors. This is akin to how humans allocate limited attention by focusing on salient information. **Resource-rational analysis** in cognitive science formalizes this: it treats mental computation as a cost and derives strategies that optimally use limited resources ([[PDF] Modeling Human Exploration Through Resource-Rational ... - NeurIPS](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/cde542f47c67907e170a1e1a7b32f6ad-Paper-Conference.pdf#:~:text=NeurIPS%20proceedings.neurips.cc%20%20Resource,and%20Brain%20Sciences%2C%2043%2C%202020)). Applying this concept, one could design the XnX system to be resource-rational – e.g., formulate a utility function that balances information gain from exploring a node vs. the “cost” (memory or time) it consumes, and always choose the next step that maximizes utility per cost. This would dynamically enforce GLF by biasing against expensive operations unless they have commensurate payoff.

In practice, LLM-based agents today often implement a form of this via **adaptive prompt strategies**. For instance, if the context window (token limit) is the GLF, the system can dynamically decide to summarize intermediate results to save tokens, or drop less relevant context as the conversation continues. This is analogous to the way **ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational)** architecture models a limited-capacity buffer for declarative memory – only the most activated chunks are fetched, others remain dormant. An LLM agent could maintain a short list of highly relevant facts (active working memory) and relegate others to long-term memory (the graph database) to manage cognitive load.

**Dynamic constraint enforcement** can also be seen in multi-agent systems and networking. For example, in network routing, each packet has constraints (like maximum allowed delay); algorithms like QoS routing will find paths meeting those constraints or report failure. The XnX system’s traversal can draw from such algorithms: treat the knowledge pieces as nodes and the GLF as a QoS requirement (e.g. path must be found under X “cost”). Approaches like **backtracking with constraint checks** at each step ensure that as soon as a partial path violates a constraint, it stops exploring deeper on that branch. This is efficient when combined with good constraint heuristics (like if a path already consumed 90% of memory budget and still far from an answer, prune it early).

On the **LLM side**, token limits and latency are key compute-bound GLFs. A practical method is to incorporate a **token budgeter** in the prompt generation. For example, a system like XnX can estimate how many tokens a particular knowledge path will add to the final prompt (since each retrieved node may contribute some text). If adding the next hop would exceed the budget, the system either stops or decides to drop something else (like an earlier context) – essentially an optimization problem: maximize relevance under a token budget. There has been work on trainable models that decide which retrieved contexts to include for a given token limit (some approach this as a knapsack problem of info value vs. length).

In terms of frameworks, one can also look at **planning algorithms under resource constraints**. *Partial Order Planning* can incorporate resource constraints by treating them as additional preconditions that must hold before an action (traversing an edge) can be taken (e.g., “memory_available > cost(edge)”). This ensures any constructed plan (path) is inherently respecting the GLF. Some recent multi-step reasoning systems for LLMs use planners that limit search breadth to simulate limited attention (e.g., “only explore top 3 relevant facts at each step” as a hard-coded constraint).

Interestingly, **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)** can be related here: ANT would consider the resource constraints (like a memory limit) as an actor in the network that mediates the outcome. From an ANT viewpoint, the GLF is not just a passive limit but an active participant that shapes the trajectory of traversal – e.g., the “token limit” actor might force the system to choose one source over another, thus changing the network of associations built in the reasoning. Though this is a more conceptual take, it aligns with building systems that explicitly model such influences.

In summary, to dynamically compute and enforce GLF-like constraints in XnX’s graph traversal, the system can integrate: 

- **Algorithmic techniques**: depth limits, label-setting multi-resource search ([Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (SPPRC) | by Nabin Kafle | Medium](https://nabinkafle.medium.com/shortest-path-problem-with-resources-constraint-spprc-971ce9b9643e#:~:text=time%20elapsed%20for%20example,than%20or%20equal%20to%20L2)), A*-like heuristics to favor low-cost expansions, and anytime refinement.
- **Heuristic strategies**: focus expansion on high-weight/high-relevance edges first (assuming edge weight `w` might denote relevance or reliability in XnX), use heuristic cut-offs for low-relevance branches to simulate limited attention.
- **Budget management**: maintain counters for tokens, API calls, or time, and at each step check against thresholds. If nearing limit, trigger behaviors like summarization or halting further expansion.
- **Parallel or interruptible search**: possibly explore multiple paths in parallel up to GLF limits and then pick the best found when time is up (similar to how modern chess algorithms deepening search and take the best move found if time runs out).

By combining these methods, the unified system can robustly respect real-time constraints. For example, it might use a beam search through the knowledge graph but with a cap on expanded nodes (like a beam width tied to GLF), ensuring it doesn’t explode combinatorially. Such a design acknowledges practical limits – whether they be an LLM’s context size or a human user’s patience – and actively manages them, rather than treating them as afterthought. This is essential for a deployable system, as it guarantees the agent’s reasoning remains *within bounds*, focusing on the most important parts of the graph given the available resources.

## 6. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in AI System Design (2020–Present)
Actor-Network Theory, originating from Science and Technology Studies (STS), has increasingly been used to analyze and inform AI systems. ANT’s core idea is that both human and non-human entities (“actors” or actants) form networks that collectively produce outcomes, emphasizing distributed agency. In recent years, researchers have applied ANT as a **theoretical lens to understand AI development and behavior**. For instance, a 2023 study in *AI and Ethics* examines ChatGPT through ANT, highlighting how human users, the algorithm, training data, and platform policies form a network of relationships with emergent power dynamics ([On actor-network theory and algorithms: ChatGPT and the new power relationships in the age of AI | AI and Ethics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00314-4#:~:text=This%20research%20paper%20examines%20the,a%20framework%20for%20understanding%20and)). The authors argue that using ANT concepts like *program* (inscriptions of developers’ intent) and *translation* (how actors align or misalign interests) reveals new power relationships in AI usage ([On actor-network theory and algorithms: ChatGPT and the new power relationships in the age of AI | AI and Ethics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00314-4#:~:text=This%20research%20paper%20examines%20the,a%20framework%20for%20understanding%20and)). The takeaway is that an AI system is not just a neutral tool; it gains quasi-agency through the network – e.g., an algorithm can shape user behavior, and users can in turn reprogram the algorithm through novel prompts (as seen with ChatGPT). This perspective encourages AI designers to account for all participants (developers, models, users, data sources) and their interactions when aiming for ethical and just systems ([On actor-network theory and algorithms: ChatGPT and the new power relationships in the age of AI | AI and Ethics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00314-4#:~:text=algorithms%20in%20the%20context%20of,a%20framework%20for%20understanding%20and)).

Applied examples blending qualitative and quantitative methods are emerging. **Erbay & Joyce (2025)** conducted a sociological study of AI development using ANT, combining interviews of software engineers with analysis of the development pipeline ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=Theory%20,and%20music%20platforms%2C%20the%20study)) ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=highlights%20how%20humans%20and%20nonhuman,central%20to%20capitalism%20and%20imperialism)). They mapped how humans (engineers, managers), non-humans (code libraries, datasets, computing infrastructure), and institutional forces (e.g. capitalist imperatives for profit) **co-produce** an AI system ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=highlights%20how%20humans%20and%20nonhuman,central%20to%20capitalism%20and%20imperialism)). Their findings showed that engineers often enlist non-human actors like “datasets” or pre-trained models as active participants – for example, a large dataset might “speak for” user behavior, leading engineers to trust its patterns, thus the dataset influences design decisions as an actor. They also identified that certain values (efficiency, profit) permeate the network and get embedded into the AI (e.g. via optimizing metrics that align with those values) ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=highlights%20how%20humans%20and%20nonhuman,central%20to%20capitalism%20and%20imperialism)) ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=plays%20a%20crucial%20role%20in,This%20ultimately%20results%20in%20the)). This kind of qualitative ANT analysis, grounded in interviews and observations, provides insights that purely technical analysis might miss – such as how an ostensibly technical constraint (like limited compute) actually embodies a social choice (budget allocation) and in turn shapes the AI’s capabilities (the AI might lack a costly component, thereby shifting what it can or cannot do).

In design, ANT encourages **seeing the architecture as a heterogeneous network**. For the XnX system, this could mean acknowledging components like the LLM, the graph database, the user’s query, and even the GLF constraints as actors that negotiate the outcome (the final answer). One practical implication is to give representation to traditionally “invisible” actors in the system’s modeling. For example, instead of treating the user query as an input string only, ANT mindset would have us model the “user” as an actor with goals and constraints influencing the process. This could lead to incorporating a user model in the loop (e.g., track what information the user likely knows already to avoid over-explaining – effectively the user’s knowledge state is an actor altering what path is relevant). It also highlights non-human agency: the knowledge graph itself can be seen as exerting agency (it “affords” certain connections and not others). Thus, one might design the XnX representation to include meta-nodes or annotations for sources and their reliability, treating “source credibility” as an actor that can strengthen or weaken certain edges (if a source is unreliable, it acts to reduce the weight of edges emanating from it, altering the traversal).

ANT has also been used in **human-machine interaction (HMI)** and anthropology of AI to create hybrid methodologies. For example, researchers have studied how an AI system implemented in a workplace becomes an actor that changes workflows, and how workers form new networks around it. In one case, an ANT-based analysis of an intelligent logistics system treated software, employees, and cargo tracking devices all as interacting actors ([(PDF) Using Actor-Network Theory to Understand Intelligent Systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367286751_Using_Actor-Network_Theory_to_Understand_Intelligent_Systems_the_Case_of_Intelligent_IS_for_Logistics?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJzY2llbnRpZmljQ29udHJpYnV0aW9ucyIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19#:~:text=%28PDF%29%20Using%20Actor,network%20of%20interacting%20heterogeneous%20actors)) ([(PDF) Using Actor-Network Theory to Understand Intelligent Systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367286751_Using_Actor-Network_Theory_to_Understand_Intelligent_Systems_the_Case_of_Intelligent_IS_for_Logistics?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJzY2llbnRpZmljQ29udHJpYnV0aW9ucyIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6bnVsbCwic3ViUGFnZSI6bnVsbH19#:~:text=Actor,network%20of%20interacting%20heterogeneous%20actors)). The finding was that the “intelligent system” agency is not localized in the software alone, but in the network of people interpreting its recommendations, sensors feeding it data, and managers setting its parameters. This suggests that when designing AI (or evaluating it), we should design for *network performance*, not just algorithm performance. In XnX’s context, that means considering how the LLM agent (algorithm actor) will work with knowledge base actors (databases), and possibly human actors (if the system is interactive with a user or expert in the loop). It could inspire features like the agent explaining its reasoning in a way that allows a human to intervene – essentially creating a *human-LLM network* for better outcomes.

In terms of mixing qualitative and quantitative: one might use ANT to guide what to measure quantitatively. If ANT reveals that certain “translations” in the network are crucial (e.g., how a user’s question gets translated into a graph query), we can then instrument the system to measure success at that translation (maybe measure if the keywords identified from the query cover the user’s intent). Similarly, ANT might highlight actors like “prompt template” – the specific prompt phrasing might drastically alter the LLM’s behavior (an insight from seeing prompt as an actor that mediates between user and model). Quantitatively, we could then experiment with different prompt actors and measure their effects.

Finally, ANT’s view of distributed agency suggests that in an RAG system, **agency is shared between the LLM and the knowledge graph**. Rather than the LLM being the sole agent solving a problem, the knowledge graph (with XnX edges encoding relationships) has agency in steering the LLM’s attention. This could inform representational features of XnX: for example, encode not just factual relations but also *action affordances*. An ANT perspective might ask, what can each node *do* in the network? Perhaps we label edges with not only semantic connection but also with what operation they afford (e.g., an edge might mean “can use Tool X to go from Node A to Node B”). This is akin to thinking in terms of **Actor-network scripts**: ANT sometimes speaks of how non-human actors have “scripts” (e.g. a speed bump has a script: “slow down cars”). In XnX, an edge notation `w x d [t1→t2]` could be extended to include a script for the LLM (“this edge suggests using definition *d* from time t1 to t2”). It’s speculative, but shows how ANT can inspire richer representations capturing how the LLM (actor) and knowledge (actors) interact.

Concrete examples of ANT in AI also appear in STS literature on algorithmic systems in society. Jenna Burrell and others have discussed algorithmic opacity as a network effect (Latour’s black box concept applied to AI). A recent systematic review in management research noted ANT is helpful in unpacking AI in organizations ([[PDF] Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=,Thus%2C%20this)) ([Actor‐Network Theory and Hybrid Assemblages in Midwifery ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11873676/#:~:text=,Social%20Theory%2C%20edited%20by)). They see AI not as a standalone artifact but as a network of training data, algorithms, developers, end-users, and institutional context. Such analyses can inform governance of AI – reminding us that to modify an AI’s behavior, one can intervene on various actors (e.g., change the data it sees, or the incentives of its operators). For XnX, this multi-actor view could inform how we might **debug or improve** the system: If answers are unsatisfactory, ANT would prompt us to check all network connections (maybe the graph is missing an actor like a key data source, or the LLM is over-asserting its own training data instead of deferring to the graph – indicating a misalignment in the actor-network that might be fixed by adjusting how the LLM “delegates” to the graph).

In summary, ANT provides a conceptual framework that can complement technical design by ensuring we consider the full ecosystem of the AI system. It encourages us to design XnX such that agency is appropriately distributed: the LLM should *delegate* to the graph for factual recall, the graph should *invite* the LLM to certain paths via its structure, and constraints like GLF should be first-class citizens in the design (not just external limits, but actors influencing the reasoning). By studying examples like the ChatGPT power dynamics ([On actor-network theory and algorithms: ChatGPT and the new power relationships in the age of AI | AI and Ethics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00314-4#:~:text=This%20research%20paper%20examines%20the,a%20framework%20for%20understanding%20and)) or sociotechnical analyses of AI development ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=Theory%20,and%20music%20platforms%2C%20the%20study)) ([Opening the Black Box of AI: A Sociological Study of AI as a Network](https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/60FCB520BEDC4F85B8CA7A7A8E6399E3#:~:text=highlights%20how%20humans%20and%20nonhuman,central%20to%20capitalism%20and%20imperialism)), we gain insight into how to incorporate notions of trust, power, and context into our system. For instance, ANT would advise clearly representing the provenance of information (each piece of info as an actor with history) so that the network of “who influences the answer” is transparent. This could manifest in XnX by tagging nodes with their source (human expert, database, sensor) and allowing the LLM to factor that into its answer (like giving more weight to certain actors when appropriate). In sum, ANT’s emphasis on *networks of agency* can guide the architecture of the unified RAG system to be more robust, interpretable, and aligned with real-world usage where many elements (human and machine) interplay.

## 7. Cross-Domain Applications of Graph-Based Hierarchical Retrieval (2023–2025)
Structured path-and-neighborhood reasoning has proven beneficial across a variety of domains beyond general QA, from software engineering to social network analysis:

- **Software Engineering:** Graph-based retrieval is tackling code search and generation tasks by leveraging the structured nature of code (e.g., syntax trees, call graphs). A recent approach, *Retrieval-Assisted Graph Code Completion (ReGCC)*, integrates graph retrieval into code completion ([Improving AST-Level Code Completion with Graph Retrieval and Multi-Field Attention | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BuzJnuwnFx&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Li%20Kuang%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Li_Kuang1)#:~:text=introduce%20GNNs%20into%20ASTlevel%20completion,and%20local%20dependency%20of%20the)) ([Improving AST-Level Code Completion with Graph Retrieval and Multi-Field Attention | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BuzJnuwnFx&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Li%20Kuang%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Li_Kuang1)#:~:text=of,distance%20dependency%20problem%20by)). It treats code’s abstract syntax tree (AST) as a graph and, given a partial AST, retrieves similar code subgraph patterns from a corpus to guide the completion. ReGCC introduced a multi-field graph attention mechanism that operates locally on the AST neighborhood (micro-level), while also attending globally and to reference graphs of similar code (macro-level) ([Improving AST-Level Code Completion with Graph Retrieval and Multi-Field Attention | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BuzJnuwnFx&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Li%20Kuang%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Li_Kuang1)#:~:text=model%20that%20searches%20for%20similar,Attention%3A%20lets%20nodes%20obtain%20valuable)) ([Improving AST-Level Code Completion with Graph Retrieval and Multi-Field Attention | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BuzJnuwnFx&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Li%20Kuang%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Li_Kuang1)#:~:text=component%20of%20both%20the%20retrieval,Furthermore%2C%20we)). This hierarchical use of graphs significantly improved accuracy in predicting the next code tokens or structures compared to using a code language model alone. Essentially, the system finds a relevant *path* in the space of code (a sequence of API calls or statements known to go together) and uses that as a backbone, then fills in details by looking at the *neighborhood* of each AST node. Another example is **CodeGRAG** (2023), which proposes constructing a composed syntax *graph* from code (beyond a tree) and using graph retrieval on it ([CodeGRAG: Extracting Composed Syntax Graphs for Retrieval ...](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.02355v1#:~:text=An%20abstract%20syntax%20tree%20,AST%20is%20constructed%20by)). In software maintenance, dependency graphs of modules have been used to retrieve impact analysis paths (which components will likely be affected by a given change). Structured reasoning on these graphs can outperform naive text search by focusing on the connectivity (e.g., if module A calls B and B calls C, a query about A’s change might retrieve C through the call chain path).

- **Science and Policy:** Researchers dealing with policy decisions or large-scale science knowledge often use knowledge graphs to connect evidence. A notable cross-domain example is the **E-KELL system** for emergency decision-making, which combines a domain-specific knowledge graph with LLM reasoning ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=system%20called%20Enhancing%20Emergency%20decision,providing%20reliable%20emergency%20decision%20support)). This system, applied in disaster management scenarios, first constructs an emergency knowledge graph (with nodes like incidents, resources, responses) and then uses a *prompt chain* to have the LLM traverse this graph in multiple steps ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=system%20called%20Enhancing%20Emergency%20decision,providing%20reliable%20emergency%20decision%20support)) ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=stages,group%20of%20emergency%20commanders%20and)). The LLM essentially follows a path: e.g. identify incident → find relevant past cases → gather recommended actions, and at each step it queries the graph for local details (neighborhood). In evaluations, this structured approach yielded highly rated decisions (in terms of accuracy and conciseness) by human emergency experts ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=stages,providing%20reliable%20emergency%20decision%20support)) ([[2311.08732] Enhancing Emergency Decision-making with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08732#:~:text=receives%20scores%20of%209,a%20novel%20approach%20to%20providing)). This demonstrates that even in critical domains like emergency response, a hierarchical retrieval (macro reasoning over situations and micro retrieval of evidence) can improve outcomes. In *science policy*, one could imagine knowledge graphs of research findings where path-based queries answer, say, “What sequence of studies led to this policy recommendation?” For instance, a system might retrieve a path connecting a basic research discovery → an applied experiment → a clinical trial → a policy guideline, each step supported by local data. While specific systems for policy are emerging, the principle is being applied in related fields like healthcare: clinical decision support graphs linking patient data to medical knowledge and guidelines. A 2024 study integrated a medical knowledge graph with LLM for patient-specific advice, essentially performing multi-hop reasoning from symptoms to diagnosis to treatment using the graph structure ([Synergistic Joint Model of Knowledge Graph and LLM for Enhancing ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/13/6/949#:~:text=,CDSSs%20combine)).

- **Social Networks:** Social network analysis benefits from graph-based retrieval when answering questions about influence or information spread. A cross-domain example is using graph paths to detect misinformation. Temporal social graphs (like retweet networks) have been used to trace how a rumor spreads: a system can retrieve the propagation path of a claim and analyze it. Recent dynamic GNNs (e.g., DynGCN, DGNF) have improved misinformation detection by modeling the *temporal propagation graph* ([Temporal Graph Learning in 2023. The story so far | by Shenyang(Andy) Huang | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/temporal-graph-learning-in-2023-d28d1640dbf2#:~:text=misinformation%20detection%20and%20understanding,are%20dynamic%20GNN%20based%20methods)) ([Temporal Graph Learning in 2023. The story so far | by Shenyang(Andy) Huang | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/temporal-graph-learning-in-2023-d28d1640dbf2#:~:text=match%20at%20L473%20misinformation%20detection,methods%20that%20incorporate%20dynamic%20graphs)). These models effectively retrieve the sequence of spread (macro-level path through users) while looking at each user’s local neighborhood (micro-level engagements) to judge credibility. In terms of RAG, one could incorporate a social graph into a retrieval process: for example, given a claim, retrieve a path of users who discussed it and what their stances are, then have an LLM use that to produce a verdict (fact-check). There have been research prototypes where a knowledge graph of claims, sources, and fact-check articles is navigated to do automated fact verification, showing improved recall of relevant evidence compared to flat IR. Another application is **community question answering** on forums: here a graph of threads and users can be leveraged. If a new question is similar to previous ones, a system might traverse the Q&A graph (finding similar questions, then their answers). Multi-hop reasoning helps: e.g., first hop – find similar question, second hop – get answer post, local neighborhood – grab any clarifications or highly upvoted comments. This was seen in some StackExchange helper bots that build a question similarity graph to retrieve past solutions.

- **Multi-Agent Systems:** When multiple AI agents or agent+human teams work together, having a shared graph for memory or communication can yield improvements. A recent example is the **Generative Agents** framework (2023) for simulating believable social interactions: it used a memory graph of interactions between agents in a virtual town (who met whom, what they discussed) and had agents retrieve paths on this graph to recall relevant info (like “agent A reminds agent B of event X via their mutual connection C”) as they converse. This led to more coherent multi-agent dialogues and planning, as each agent’s actions were informed by a chain of remembered events rather than isolated facts. In multi-robot systems, graph-based world models (like topological maps of an environment) are shared among robots to plan paths without collisions. If one robot discovers a shortcut, it adds it as an edge; others can then retrieve that path. The hierarchical aspect comes in if the map is too large – robots might share a coarse map (macro) for global route planning and use their own local maps (micro) for precise navigation, akin to path + neighborhood reasoning.

For LLM-based multi-agent setups, some research (2023–2024) had agents that specialize (e.g., one reasoning, one executing code, one verifying). They often pass messages via a structured format. We can think of this communication as a graph (with agents as nodes and message references as edges). Ensuring consistency often involved retrieving the chain of reasoning (one agent’s output becomes another’s input, etc.). By explicitly maintaining the “conversation graph”, systems like HuggingGPT (which coordinates multiple models) improved task completion because they could follow the dependency path of subtasks. Each model’s output is treated as a node that subsequent models can refer to, and a controller navigates this graph to assemble the final answer.

- **Multi-Modal Graph Learning:** Cutting-edge applications incorporate images, text, and other modalities into a unified graph to answer complex queries. One 2023 approach, **MR-MKG (Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graphs)**, builds a knowledge graph where some nodes are visual (images or image regions) and others textual, with edges linking them (e.g., an image of a landmark linked to a Wikipedia article of that landmark) ([Multi-modal Knowledge Graph - Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/multi-modal-knowledge-graph#:~:text=Multi,a%20comprehensive%20understanding%20of%20entities)). For a question like “What is depicted in the painting and who painted it?”, the system can traverse: Image node (painting) → text node (its description) → text node (artist name). MR-MKG showed improved performance on tasks like multimodal analogy reasoning by leveraging such cross-modal paths, outperforming unimodal baselines ([Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.02030v1#:~:text=Experimental%20results%20on%20multimodal%20question,MKG%20method%20outperforms)). Another example, **MKGF** for medical VQA, combined patient images (like X-rays) with a medical knowledge graph (diseases, symptoms, treatments) to help a vision-language model. It retrieved relevant facts from the graph (e.g., “opacity in lung X-ray → possible pneumonia”) and integrated them into the answer generation, significantly improving accuracy on medical visual questions ([MKGF: A multi-modal knowledge graph based RAG framework to ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092523122500671X#:~:text=,Author%20links%20open%20overlay%20panel)). Essentially, the model followed a path from the visual evidence to a diagnosis via the graph’s connections, demonstrating the power of structured cross-modal reasoning.

In creative domains, multi-modal graphs are used for things like movie understanding: nodes might be characters (with images, descriptions), events, and dialogue lines. A system answering questions about a movie can walk the graph (character A image → character A bio → character A’s relationship to B) to answer something like “Why did character A betray B?”. Instead of reading the whole script, it navigates the knowledge graph of the plot. Early results show that combining video, subtitles, and metadata in a graph helps QA models retrieve specific needed moments or facts.

**Cross-domain trends:** These applications show a common thread – **hierarchical graph retrieval improves results when information is complex or distributed**. In software engineering, structured retrieval understands code contexts better (leading to fewer syntax errors and more relevant suggestions). In science and policy, evidence is often scattered; graph paths gather the pieces logically (improving trustworthiness and completeness). Social network and multi-agent systems are inherently graph-structured, so embracing that structure (rather than flattening to text) yields more coherent and explainable reasoning. Multi-modal problems benefit because graphs provide a bridge between modalities (a path can naturally hop from an image node to a text node, something hard for a purely text or purely visual model to do).

The proposed XnX unified system is well-aligned with these trends. Its ability to traverse a shared graph database with both path-following and neighborhood expansion is a generalized solution that these domains have reinvented in specific forms. For example, XnX could be applied to code: treat AST nodes and their relationships as the graph, where `[t1→t2]` could encode version timelines or code evolution constraints, and use PathRAG to retrieve common code idioms (paths) and GraphRAG to get local implementations. Or apply XnX to a multi-modal medical KB: nodes are symptoms, test results (images), diagnoses with temporal constraints (onset [t1→t2] edges for symptom progression), then use the unified approach to answer diagnostic questions by exploring both the sequence of events and the local imaging evidence at each step. 

In conclusion, the period 2023–2025 has witnessed graph-based retrieval techniques advancing the state-of-the-art in diverse areas like programming assistance, emergency response, misinformation analysis, collaborative AI, and multi-modal understanding. In all these cases, **structured reasoning – moving along graph paths and examining neighborhoods – provided a clear boost**. This cross-domain success bodes well for the XnX system, which generalizes the idea of unified path-neighborhood navigation. By learning from these cutting-edge applications, the XnX framework can be tuned to ensure that path relevance is maximized and information redundancy minimized (a common challenge in all domains), and that the system can seamlessly handle various data types and complexities through its graph representation. Each domain’s success story essentially serves as validation that the core ideas behind XnX (hierarchical retrieval, constraint-aware traversal, distributed reasoning) are effective strategies for enhancing RAG systems.
